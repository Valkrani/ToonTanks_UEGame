# Toon Tanks Game
with the help of Udemy course "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games" by GameDev.tv

Once i completed the course i was interested in expanding it, a bit.

## Controls:
W and S - forward and backwards

A and D - turn

left click - shoot


There are medpacks around the so that you can heal. Some even give armor!

## Assets used:
- Low Poly Town by PolyArt3D (got for free)
- base tank and base turret models, the variants ive modified myself. Rrovided by the GameDev.tv Course 

## Contents:
It has a simple main menu with 3 different turret types and 2 body types.

First level is showcasing the enemy turret types and the healing modules.

Second level features the basic turret model, so the user can get the hang of it.

Third level features all the turret models.

Not a fan of level design so i wont be doing another.

First unreal engine project ive made, its really messy and needs to be remade with the knowledge have gained from it
